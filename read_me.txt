this is my first complete project :
 it started with the intention of creating a word jumble game in python then I decided to turn it into a  Gui desktop using Tkinter.  
I added so many features such as sounds, reset color to the original one set the color background, night mod, status labels, a hard mode for additional challenge hint button, Hover effect, and so on...
if u face a  problem with changing color just hit the fix bug color
